# StudyFocuser

This project aims to develop a study-focused device that enhances concentration and productivity by implementing the Pomodoro Technique and detecting distractions such as phone usage and gaze detection (looking left or right or leaving camera frame).

The Study Focuser Pomodoro is a sophisticated tool designed to aid individuals in maintaining focus and productivity during study sessions. Built around the principles of the Pomodoro Technique, it offers structured study intervals with 30-minute sessions followed by 5-minute breaks. At its core is a Raspberry Pi board, which orchestrates the system's operations and interfaces with its various components.

Key to the Study Focuser Pomodoro's functionality is its utilization of advanced technology, including a camera module and sensors. The camera module monitors the user's eyes for signs of drowsiness, while sensors detect phone usage, a common source of distraction. When the user is not in frame, is looking left/right, or phone usage is detected during study sessions, LED alerts are triggered to gently remind the user to stay focused, facilitating an environment conducive to concentration and productivity.

During breaks, the system provides respite from alerts, allowing users to relax and recharge before the next study session. By integrating technology with the proven methodology of the Pomodoro Technique, the Study Focuser Pomodoro offers a comprehensive solution for enhancing study habits and fostering a more efficient and effective approach to learning.
